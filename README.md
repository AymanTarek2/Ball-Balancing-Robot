# Ball Balancing Robot

## Overview

The Ball Balancing Robot is designed to maintain the balance of a ball on a platform using advanced control systems and real-time processing techniques. This project features the integration of an STM32 microcontroller, stepper motor drivers, an ESP32-CAM for image processing, and PID control algorithms for precise ball balancing.

## Features

- **Control System**: Implemented with STM32 microcontroller for reliable performance.
- **Motor Control**: Integrated with stepper motor drivers for precise motor control.
- **Image Processing**: Utilized ESP32-CAM to capture and process images for ball position detection.
- **PID Control**: Applied PID control algorithms to keep the ball centered on the platform.
- **RTOS**: Leveraged Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for efficient task management on the STM32.

## Components

- **STM32 Microcontroller**: Central controller for the robot.
- **Stepper Motor Drivers**: Drives the stepper motors.
- **ESP32-CAM**: Provides image capture and processing.
- **Stepper Motors**: Adjusts the tilt of the platform to balance the ball.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Connect the STM32 microcontroller to the stepper motor drivers.
   - Interface the ESP32-CAM with the STM32 for image data transfer.
   - Connect the stepper motors to the stepper motor drivers.

2. **Testing**:
   - Power on the system and ensure proper component connections.
   - Test the balancing performance and adjust PID parameters if needed.
